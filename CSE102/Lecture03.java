         * if a method takes a parameter of for example Person class, it can be invoked with any class which are
         * subclasses of Person.
         * If the method is defined with a parameter of Object type, then it can be invoked with any object.
         * This feature is called polymorphism.

         * Consider Class's GradStudent, Student, Person, Object and a method met defined with parameter Object

         * public static void met(Object somebody){

         * JVM binds the appropriate toString() method of which class's instance (Student? , Person?...) is passed to
         * met This is called dynamic binding.
         *When a method is called, Java searches the method in the class's in an order from most specific to most
         * general (the most general class is the Object class) and calls the first found one.
